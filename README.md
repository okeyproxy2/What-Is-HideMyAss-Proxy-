# Safety of HideMyAss Proxy

[HideMyAss](https://www.okeyproxy.com/proxy/use-hidemyass-proxy-to-hide-your-ip/) (HMA) is a reputable proxy and VPN service provider, prioritizing user security and privacy. However, there are a few considerations to bear in mind:

Web Proxies: HMA's web proxy service is free and facilitates anonymous web surfing by concealing your IP address. While it aids in maintaining privacy, it does not encrypt your data, potentially leaving it vulnerable to interception, especially on unsecured networks.

VPN Services: HMA's VPN service offers heightened security by not only hiding your IP address but also encrypting your data with robust 256-bit encryption, enhancing protection against interception.

Logging Policy: HMA adheres to a no-logs policy, refraining from storing details of your online activities. However, they do collect minimal user data such as connection date (excluding time), data volume transmitted, and the subnet of your original IP address, retained for 30 days.
